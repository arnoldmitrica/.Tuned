# .Tuned
.Tuned is a news feed app and at this moment is under development. Furthermore of what can be seen here using Swift, It uses Firebase Firestore and,
Firebase Cloud Functions which is very important in back-end for creating No-Sql databases automatically with each user's feed tree in Firestore.
It needs Typescript or Javascript to build each Cloud Function in Node.js Firebase SDK.
Shortly I will add Better designs.
